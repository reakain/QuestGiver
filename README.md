# Quest Giver
A twitter bot to provide quests for eager adventurers!

This python3 program uses tweepy and nltk to create procedural quest dialogue and post it to twitter for all who tweet at it.

## Build Docker Image to Test
 1. Run the command in the bash shell from the project directory:

     ```docker build . -t quest-giver-bot```

 2. Test your build from powershell with
   
     ```docker run -it -e CONSUMER_KEY="key val here" -e CONSUMER_SECRET="key val here" -e ACCESS_TOKEN="key val here" -e ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="key val here" quest-giver-bot```

## Build and Deploy Docker Image
Note: Everything is in the bash shell for this part! This is also for digital ocean droplets, and `twitter-bot-drop` is the name of my digital ocean droplet that I'm making and `quest-giver-bot` is the docker image name.
1. If you don't have anything registered as a docker-machine (which controls multiple instances of docker images) then you make one.
   
    ```docker-machine create --driver digitalocean --digitalocean-access-toker YOUR-ACCESS-TOKE-HERE twitter-bot-drop```

2. Then this command sets your current shell environment to be your docker-machine shell environment
   
    `eval $(docker-machine env twitter-bot-drop)`

3. Then in your new shell you build your docker image
   
    `docker build . -t quest-giver-bot`

4. And then deploy it! The only difference here is the -id instead of -it which just tells it you want it to be detached from your shell.
   
    `docker run -id -e CONSUMER_KEY="key val here" -e CONSUMER_SECRET="key val here" -e ACCESS_TOKEN="key val here" -e ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="key val here" quest-giver-bot`

Et voila! Functioning docker image running on your droplet (which is called a docker-machine)
